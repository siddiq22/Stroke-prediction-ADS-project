Objectives:
The main objective of this project is to use the data monitoring heart conditions of patients and use the said data to predict if the patient will have a stroke or not. The project will make use of Machine Learning models to use the technique of Supervised Learning in order to predict the possibility of stroke. 

Usefulness:
As the field of medicine grows, it is essential for us to be able to create systems that increase the efficiency of medical diagnosis and treatment. With the help of a predictor which takes in the required features and outputs if the patient being monitored is prone to the risk of a stroke or not. This allows the doctors to take action as soon as possible. 

MetSCalc [1] is an existing tool that uses data to calculate Metabolic Syndrome severity. The tool makes use of javascript for the build. With this project, we aim to make use of more efficient python tools and libraries to predict and visualize the results. 

The application is mainly targeted toward doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers who monitor their patients to ensure the treatment is given in a timely manner.
